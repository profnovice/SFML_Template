# Ongoing c++ simple game engine from scratch using CMake SFML Project Template

Learning process with C++, SFML, CMake, etc.

## Git commit format

### Example:

feat(src): Add new jump ability 

Testers were bored while in the air so this flip ability should 
give them something to do.

### Flags:

chore: typos, documentation<br />
style: reformatting, rearranging<br />   
feat: new feature, system<br />   
fix: solution to an issue<br />   
refac: making it better without changing what it does<br />   
test: check to see that things run correctly<br />   
explr: experiment with libraries and new features<br />   
clean: remove unnecessary code or comments<br />   

### Areas:

git: workflows<br />    
docs: README and LICENSE etc.<br />   
src: source code<br />   
assets: textures, config, .ttf etc.<br />      

### Creed: 

Separate subject from body with a blank line<br />   
Limit the subject line to 50 characters<br />   
Capitalize the subject line<br />   
Do not end the subject line with a period<br />   
Use the imperative mood in the subject line: "if applied this commit will"<br />   
Wrap the body at 72 characters<br />   
Use the body to explain what and why vs. how<br />
